### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rahman â€” an MSc Artificial Intelligence student based in Dubai, currently working in RegTech (Regulatory Technology).
I'm passionate about building innovative, user-friendly apps that automate and accelerate everyday tasks. While I'm not a traditional software engineer by title, I enjoy using code to solve problems and streamline workflows.
I work primarily with JavaScript, Python, and Java, and have hands-on experience with React and modern web technologies.
Always open to chatting about AI, automation, or development in general â€” feel free to reach out!
